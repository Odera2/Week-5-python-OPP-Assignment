# Week-5-python-OPP-Assignment


## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project showcases basic concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using Python. It is divided into two main activities:

1. **Activity 1**: Creating a custom class with constructors, attributes, methods, and inheritance to demonstrate encapsulation and polymorphism.
2. **Activity 2**: A polymorphism challenge using classes like `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat`, each with its own implementation of the `move()` method.
